# My-Data-Science-Projects
The file below has links to the projects that I created from scratch as a part of Coursera courses. However, there were a lot of course assignments (ungraded) in the middle that taught me skills shown in these notebooks but also other capabilities in Data Science.
Please, note, if they do not render good, use this [link](https://jupyter.org/).
1) [Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard ](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/7d71dbaa-eef8-4aae-9f1a-1d68d3156249/view?projectid=f1c0c295-2231-4a5f-944e-303a6b06b2b6&context=analytics)
Performing basic tasks with Python, getting to know Jupyter notebooks.
2) [Battle of Neighborhoods: Where to set up a café in Rotterdam?](https://github.com/ganastas/github-example)
Using Pandas, Clustering, and folium maps to discover the best place to set up cafes in Rotterdam. Please, note that Folium maps are not visible through GitHub. To see them, paste the link of the workbook to https://jupyter.org/.
3) [Predicting grades of students in Dutch Schools](https://github.com/ganastas/Predicting-grades-of-students-in-Dutch-schools)
This project concerns predictions about students' school performance based on how well they studied in school, so their average school year grade, as well as how good they performed on their school exams. The models used were: Regression analysis as well as Deep Neural network training.
4) [Coursera customer service Chatbot](https://assistant-chat-eu-gb.watsonplatform.net/web/public/23dfaf0c-884e-4d56-abe7-5d3ff3fa8247)
This Chatbot helps students to get information about course recommendations, course financing, and financial aid. The chatbot was created using Watson Assistant and Watson Discovery. The integration between these 2 services happened through Python. The chatbot was also deployed to Slack and Facebook. However, the preview is not available there due to privacy restrictions.
5) [Neural Network with Keras](https://gist.github.com/ganastas/5b9bc0396fccbea2022f97b084cd9375)
This Neural Network was built to predict the strengths of cement based on certain parameters, such as Fly Ash, Water, Age, etc. The model was implemented in Python and built with Keras language. The training process is verbalized, therefore, you can see how the error decreased in each of the epochs. There are 4 models that you can compare with each other. The best perfoming one is with several layers and normalized data (D) and with more training epochs and normalized data (C). Model С is also more robust as std of error is smaller.
6) [Fashion MNIST classification](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/3e9f0b01-372b-48c1-a163-f5c16f302b57/view?projectid=ba39c31c-1271-4b62-9044-b30d71507ac0&context=analytics)
PyTorch in Python was used to classify images of fashionable items (e.g. shirts, shoes, etc) into different categories. The images had to be transformed to Tensors prior to classification. Later a Convolutional Neural netwrok, with 2 convolutional, 2 maxpooling, and 1 fully connected layer were created. The SGD optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss were used. The model achieved over 86% accuracy.
